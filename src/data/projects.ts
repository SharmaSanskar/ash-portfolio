    "description": "Internal communications design and social media strategy for Sophia College",
    "overview": "As Head of PR at Sophia College (May 2023 – April 2024), I led the design and rollout of internal communications assets, including posters, email visuals, and Instagram content. This work was part of a broader strategy to keep students informed, engaged, and excited about campus events.",
    "designApproach": "My goal was to make information instantly clear while keeping the visuals chic and student-friendly. Most of the graphics leaned into a minimal, feminine aesthetic—centered around Sophia's signature peach and green, with splashes of beige and brown tones. I intentionally crafted designs that resonated with our majority-women audience. On social, I paired dynamic visuals with fun, trending audios to spotlight campus life and drive engagement among students.",
