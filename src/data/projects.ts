    "description": "Internal communications design and social media strategy for Sophia College",
    "overview": "As Head of PR at Sophia College (May 2023 – April 2024), I led the design and rollout of internal communications assets, including posters, email visuals, and Instagram content. This work was part of a broader strategy to keep students informed, engaged, and excited about campus events.",
    "designApproach": "My goal was to make information instantly clear while keeping the visuals chic and student-friendly. Most of the graphics leaned into a minimal, feminine aesthetic—centered around Sophia's signature peach and green, with splashes of beige and brown tones. I intentionally crafted designs that resonated with our majority-women audience. On social, I paired dynamic visuals with fun, trending audios to spotlight campus life and drive engagement among students.",

    "designApproach": "I leaned into a dark, moody aesthetic to reflect Offsuit's intimate and elusive vibe. The graphics featured cocktail details, bar textures, and shadowy lighting—evoking the speakeasy mystique while still drawing intrigue.

The organization partnered with our class to help shape a fresh, flexible content deck for social and digital use.",
    "designApproach": "Working within a strict brand kit, I explored layered overlays, textured backgrounds, and bold text treatments to bring energy and rhythm to the visual language. Many of the graphics incorporated music elements—vinyls, waveforms, and vintage mic silhouettes—with a retro jazz-inspired vibe running through the entire deck.
